In Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord, "eager loading" and "preloading" are both techniques used to optimize database queries by reducing the number of database calls 
made during the retrieval of associated records. However, they operate slightly differently:

Eager Loading:

Eager loading refers to the practice of loading associated records along with the main record in a single query. 
It is achieved using the includes method in ActiveRecord queries.
When we eager load associations, ActiveRecord generates a single SQL query that fetches both the main record and its associated records in one go, reducing the number of database queries required.



Example :

@posts = Post.includes(:comments)                 # Eager loading using includes

In this example, @posts will contain a collection of Post objects, and each Post object will have its associated Comment objects loaded eagerly.



Preloading:

Preloading, on the other hand, is similar to eager loading but operates at a slightly lower level. 
It loads the associated records separately from the main query but does so more efficiently than lazy loading.
Preloading is useful when you need to access the associated records individually but still want to minimize the number of database queries.

Example:

# Preloading using preload
@posts = Post.all.preload(:comments)
In this example, @posts will contain a collection of Post objects, but the associated Comment objects won't be loaded immediately. However, when you access the comments association of each Post object, ActiveRecord will have already fetched all the associated Comment records in advance, reducing the need for additional queries.

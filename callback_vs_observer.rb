Rails Callback:

Callbacks are methods, which can be called at certain moments of an objectâ€™s life cycle.

for example -

it can be called when an object is created, updated, deleted.
A call back is short lived.

Types of Callbacks:

Rails provides various types of callbacks such as before_validation,

after_validation, before_save, after_save, before_create, after_create, before_update, after_update, before_destroy, after_destroy, etc.

class User < ApplicationRecord
  before_save :normalize_name


  private

  def normalize_name
    self.name = name.downcase
  end
end


Rails Observers:

Observers is same like Callback in rails, but it is used when method is not directly associated to object life cycle.
Also, the observer lives longer, and it can be detached or attached at any time.

Example:

Create your observer with following command :

$ rails g observer User


This will create new file with name user_observer.rb
Then in this file define the models you wish to observe [One Observer can observe multiple models] and then add the before_save callback.


class UserObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer
  observe :user, :customer
 
  def before_save(user)
    user.name = user.name.downcase
  end
end



Drawbacks of Callbacks


One potential drawback of using callbacks is that they can make your code harder to understand and maintain.
If you have a lot of complex business logic that is spread out across multiple callbacks,
It can be difficult to keep track of what is happening at each stage of the object's lifecycle.
Additionally, callbacks can sometimes be triggered unexpectedly, leading to unexpected behavior or bugs.

To mitigate these risks, it is important to use callbacks judiciously and to keep your callback logic simple and easy to understand.
You should also write tests to ensure that your callbacks are behaving as expected and to catch any bugs that may arise
